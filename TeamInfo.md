## Project Summary

For our project, we’ll be creating a website that displays a graph correlating the number of household pets to the amount of drug use in each state. Users will be able to interact with the graph by moving their mouse to hover over specific points on the graph, which will show more details of each state’s drug use and pet ownership. Since raising pets requires a large amount of responsibility for not only yourself, but for another being, we’re hoping to see a negative correlation between household pets and amount of drug use to show that pet’s can be a good form of addiction therapy. 

We’ll have a map of the US formatted so that when you click on each state, there’s a graph that displays the summarized data from the SAMHDA dataset.
For each state, you’ll see drug use rates, illicit drug use rates, alcohol abuse rates, marijuana usage rates, etc.
We will also have an overall graph displaying all the different usage rates for ALL 50 states, as well as a search interface where users can search for specific things and we create the necessary subqueries to get results.

Our chosen application is useful because it can show the relationship between drug usage and pet ownership for each state. If we’re able to show that there’s a significantly large correlation between the two, it would also hint at the benefits of having household pets. There aren’t any similar websites that have the same features as ours will.
